# visitors
A fabric mod allowing non-whitelisted players to check out the server in spectator mode before applying. 


Features:
- allows players not on the whitelist to join in spectator mode
- when player is whitelisted, they should be able to start playing
- optional /discord command with clickable discord invite to apply in

Notes:
- requires FabricAPI
- restores spawn position & default gamemode once player is whitelisted
- whitelist needs to be on, otherwise, this wont work (and is probably unnecessary)
- banned players can't join, duh
- WIP: i intend to (at some point) add a adventure-mode-like visitor mode, so players can interact with other players while not being able to interact with the world

Currently supported versions: 1.19.3
